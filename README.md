# Log-analysis-tool
This tool will read log files, extract relevant information, and identify anomalies. For demonstration purposes, I’ll provide a simple example using a hypothetical log format.

Notes:

Customize the parse_log_file function to match your log format (e.g., Apache logs, Windows event logs, etc.).
You’ll need to handle different log formats, timestamps, and specific fields based on your use case.
Consider adding logic to detect anomalies (e.g., failed login attempts, suspicious IP addresses, etc.) based on your analysis requirements.
Remember to adapt this script to your specific log files and enhance it as needed. Happy analyzing! 📊🔍👩‍💻
